                <p>I am very interested in exploring internship and career opportunities at Target, particularly in marketing, which aligns with my current field of study. However, I believe that any role at Target would provide valuable professional experience.

                    <li>Organized and reliable with leadership experience (team captain roles and event organization).</li>
                    <li>Strong work ethic and willingness to learn across departments.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How my skills align</h4>
                <p>My coursework and activities have built practical communication and organizational skills that map well to marketing roles. I bring a dependable attitude, fast learning ability, and experience working on teams — all of which support Target's customer- and team-focused environment.</p>
