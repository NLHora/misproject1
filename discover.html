        <h2>Why I chose UMD</h2>
        <p>I chose to go to the University of Minnesota Duluth for numerous reasons. First, I have always enjoyed visiting Duluth with my family, and the city’s size is perfect for me, there are plenty of hikes and places to explore in the area but also many things to do in town. Another major factor was the business school, which aligns well with my academic and career goals. Lastly, I was drawn to the campus, it offers a comfortable environment with high quality dining and housing options.</p>
		<h2>About UMD</h2>
		<p>There are so many things I like about Duluth. One of my favorites things in Duluth is the scenery and hikes, I love to do outdoor activities and going on the hikes around Duluth is very enjoyable for me. Additionally, there is so much to do in town like different events, festivals, and restaurants that are enjoyable.</p>
		<h2>UMD Campus Highlights</h2>
		<p>The UMD campus has so many things to do, one of my favorite things about UMD is that everything is connected, so in the cold winter I don't have to walk outside. Additionally, the gym is very well-maintained with lots of machines and weights to workout,something I am very passionate about. Lastly, the food options around campus are one of my absolute favorite things about UMD, there are numerous delicious and diverse options to offer around campus from the dining hall to the food court!</p>
